# Transfer Learning - How to leverage pretrained model to speed up training for machine learning
Hide Inada

## Problem statement
Imagine you are a machine learning engineer working for a photo sharing website.
One morning, your manager comes to you and asks you to develop a feature that classifies food images into categories so that your company's website can show a restaurant nearby that serves food in that category of the photo on the page, and could raise an ad revenue from restaurants.

The problem is that your manager's manager really wants this feature yesterday and your manager was not able to push back so now he is asking you if there is anyway you can come up with something.
Aside from recommending to your manager that your manager and your manager's manager should take the Management 101 class, is there anything you can do to meet this crazy deadline?

You want to train at least tens of thousands of images which can take days.  Not only that you are not really sure about hyperparameter setting, so tuning that will multiply the time required for training.  On top of that, you are not really sure if your company has the powerful enough hardware to do this training.

Is there a way?

Yes, possibly.

## Concept
It takes significant machine resources and time to train the model especially when there are so many layers.

However, there is a way to short circuit the training process.

This is called transfer learning.

This is based on the assumption that :
Deep neural network is trained to extract features in various layers.
If you go all the way up to the layer one before the output layer, feature extraction is already done.
and classification is mapping the various features with the final classification.
If you train a deep neural network with data that is similar to the data that you want to all you need to do is train the last output layer.

## Dataset preparation
You can use any dataset that you want, but I used Food-101 dataset.  Please see the below page if you want to use this dataset: 
https://github.com/hideyukiinada/transfer-learning/blob/master/food101.md


## Set up
Clone this repo to download:
* retrain.py
* label_img.py

retrain.py and label_img.py were developed by the TensorFlow team and licensed under the terms listed at the top of each file.

If you want to check for the newer version, you can check hub and tensorflow repos:
```
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/hub
diff hub/examples/image_training/retrain.py <path to this retrain.py>
```

```
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
diff tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/label_image/label_image.py <path to this label_img.py>
```

food-101.tar.gz

```
tar zxvf food-101.tar.gz
```

This expands the files to:

food-101/images/<category name>/<file name>
 
 For example,
food-101/images/spaghetti_bolognese/3294753.jpg
 

Containing 101,000 images of 101 categories.
Each category contains:
training set: 750 
test set: 250
